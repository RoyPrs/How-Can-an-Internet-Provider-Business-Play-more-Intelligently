# How-Can-an-Internet-Provider-Business-Play-more-Intelligently

This is an end-to-end business intelligence project aims to help a customer service provider team identify the pain points of their 
workflow and set the stage for working more intelligently. The project starts with developing the documents needed for every BI projcet 
which includes project introduction, the stakeholders, the company, the dataset, the desired results and the success metrics along with 
further considerations. The next step is all about designing and ETL pipeline using postgreSQL and in the final step I analyze the data to 
provide the team to the desired insights.
